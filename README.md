# 🧠 SSJ3-ML-Journey

Welcome to my **SSJ3-style AI learning tracker** — a focused repository documenting my in-depth learning of **Mathematics for AI** and **Hands-On Machine Learning (3rd Edition)**.

Like Goku stepping into the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, this is my deep work zone to master theory, apply code, and evolve toward becoming a **Data Scientist & AI Researcher** during my MTech @ IIT Kanpur.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Strengthen foundational math behind AI: **Linear Algebra, Probability, Optimization**
- Understand and implement key ML workflows using **Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy**
- Solve practical problems using models like **Regression, Decision Trees, Ensemble, SVMs**
- Build hands-on intuition with **real-world datasets**, **pipelines**, and **tuning**
- Track progress daily via Jupyter notebooks and written notes

## 🗓️ Study Plan

See [roadmap.md](./roadmap.md) for my weekly breakdown and tracking logs.

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech Stack

- Python 3.11
- Jupyter Notebooks
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
- LaTeX / Markdown (for notes)
- GitHub for version control & journaling

## 📈 Progress Tracker

I log daily reading, exercises, and breakthroughs inside the `journal/` folder.

Feel free to explore:

- 📘 Math concepts → `math_for_ai/notes/`
- 🔢 Math notebooks → `math_for_ai/notebooks/`
- 🤖 ML workflows → `hands_on_ml/`
- 📝 Logs → `journal/`

## 🌱 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add quiz-style markdowns after each chapter
- [ ] Implement mini-projects using learned ML models
- [ ] Add Colab links for key notebooks
- [ ] Add Notion sync for quick review
